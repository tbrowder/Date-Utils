=head1 NAME

B<Date::Utils> - Provides helpful date routines for calendar creation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use Date::Utils;
...# use the routines to create a calendar
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Date::Utils> is a collection of routines to help users calculate
certain dates in relation to other dates provided by Raku's powerful
C<Date> class. 

The ISO standard calendar week begins on Monday
as day-of-the-week (DoW) one and and ends on Sunday, DoW seven,
but the default in the subroutines herein is set for the US 
practice of beginning the calendar week
on Sunday.  However, that default is easily changed
by the named parameter C<:$cal-first-dow> as seen in the signatures
of pertinent subroutines
listed below.

=head1 Routines provided in this module

=begin item
C<days-of-week>

Given the day-of-week (DoW) for the start of a calendar
week, return a list of the DoWs.
Access the list with the C<day-index-in-week>.

=begin code
sub days-of-week(
    DoW $cal-first-dow = 7, # Sunday
    :$debug,
    --> List # range 1..7
) is export {
=end code
=end item

=begin item
C<day-index-in-week>

Given the day-of-week (DoW) of any day of a week,
and the starting DoW for a calendar week, 
this routine returns the index of that DoW
in a list of the calendar's DoWs.
Use the index with the list from C<days-of-week>.

=begin code
sub day-index-in-week(
    DoW $dow, # range 1..7
    DoW :$cal-first-dow = 7, # Sunday
    :$debug,
    --> UInt # range 0..6
) is export {...}
=end code
=end item


=begin item
C<days-in-week1>

Given the day-of-week (DoW) of the first Date of the month,
and the starting DoW for a calendar week, 
this routine returns the number of days remaining
in the month's first calendar week.

=begin code
subset DoW of Int where { 0 < $_ < 8 }
sub days-in-week1(
    DoW $first-dow,
    DoW :$cal-first-dow = 7, # Sunday, US practice
    :$debug,
    --> DoW
) is export {...}
=end code
=end item

=begin item
C<weeks-in-month>

These two multi-subs return the total number of full and partial
seven-day weeks in a calendar month where the day-of-week order begins
with any desired day and ends the week six days later. The default is
to start calendar weeks on Sunday and end on Saturday as normally used
in US calendars. 

=begin code
multi sub weeks-in-month(
    :$year!, :$month!,
    DoW :$cal-first-dow = 7, # Sunday
    :$debug
    --> UInt) {...}

multi sub weeks-in-month(
    Date $date,
    DoW :$cal-first-dow = 7, # Sunday
    :$debug
    --> UInt) {...}
=end code
=end item

=begin item
C<nth-day-of-week-in-month>

=begin code
sub nth-day-of-week-in-month(
    :$year!, :$month!, :$nth! is copy,
    DoW :$day-of-week!,
    :$debug
    --> Date) {...}
=end code

If C<$nth> is greater than the actual number of C<day-of-week>s in the
desired month or if that number is zero or negative, the date of its
last appearance in that month is returned.

As a convenience, a version of the same routine requiring fewer key
strokes is provided:

=begin code
sub nth-dow-in-month(
    :$year!, :$month!, :$nth! is copy,
    DoW :$dow!,
    :$debug
    --> Date) {...}
=end code
=end item

=begin item
C<nth-day-of-week-after-date>

=begin code
sub nth-day-of-week-after-date(
    Date :$date!, :$nth! is copy,
    DoW :$day-of-week!,
    :$debug
    --> Date) {...}
=end code

As a convenience, a version of the same routine requiring fewer key
strokes is provided:

=begin code
sub nth-dow-after-date(
    Date :$date!, :$nth! is copy,
    DoW :$dow!,
    :$debug
    --> Date) {...}
=end code
=end item

=Notes

A more general routine has been added since the original release
to calculate the I<weeks-in-month> for B<any> starting day of the 
week (DoW) given its number (Monday through Sunday) as a Raku Date 
DoW in the range 1..7 (the default DoW order for a Raku Date).
The routine is important for laying out a calendar because it
determines the vertical space required for the presentation.

With a calendar week starting on Monday, the Raku Date DoW values for
a month are shown below along with the corresponding calendar values
for a 31-day month starting on a Friday.  Note there are five calendar
weeks consisting of one partial week followed by four full weeks.

=begin code
Code             Days
M T W T F S S    Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
        5 6 7                 1  2  3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7     4  5  6  7  8  9 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7    11 12 13 14 15 16 17
1 2 3 4 5 6 7    18 19 20 21 22 23 24
1 2 3 4 5 6 7    25 26 27 28 29 30 31
=end code

Changing the calendar week start day can have significant effects. If the 
calendar week starts on a Sunday, the Date DoW numbers and the
calendar days for the B<same month> change to the form shown below.  
Note there are now B<six> calendar weeks consisting of one partial
week followed by four full weeks followed by one partial week.

=begin code
Code             Days
S M T W T F S    Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
          5 6                    1  2
7 1 2 3 4 5 6     3  4  5  6  7  8  9
7 1 2 3 4 5 6    10 11 12 13 14 15 16
7 1 2 3 4 5 6    17 18 19 20 21 22 23
7 1 2 3 4 5 6    24 25 26 27 28 29 30
7                31
=end code

Raku's
C<Date> routines provide us with two known values of the month
that will enable the needed calculations. They are:

=begin code
A: Date.first-date-of-month.day-of-week # range: 1..7
B: Date.days-in-month                   # range: 28..31
=end code

Given the first value (A), and knowing the DoWs retain their order,
we can derive the Date days in the first calendar week. 
The lists of Date DoWs stay in the proper order as shown
in the following code:

=begin code
my @dows = 1..7;
for @dows -> $cal-start-day {
    say "$cal-start-day: {@dows.rotate($cal-start-day-1)}";
}
# OUTPUT:
1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
2: 2 3 4 5 6 7 1
3: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2
4: 4 5 6 7 1 2 3
5: 5 6 7 1 2 3 4
6: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5
7: 7 1 2 3 4 5 6
=end code

Therefore, we must get one of the above sequences during the first week,
which can range from one to seven days. 
Also note that each sequence is defined by its first day number,
but it doesn't necessarily include a full set of days, as seen in a
partial first week.

For example, given a calendar week that starts on Sunday (Date DoW 7)
and the first day of the month is a Date DoW of 2 (Tuesday),
using the routine C<days-in-week1> yields a value of 5 which is the 
number of days remaining in that first week.

=begin code
C: days-in-week1 7, 2  # OUTPUT: 5
=end code

Subtracting that number from the B<A> value (C<Date.days-in-month>)
yields the number of days left in the month: C<D = A - C = 26>.

Dividing the remaining days by seven (and rounding up by one for
any partial week) gives us the remaining 
weeks, leading to the desired result:

=begin code
$cal-weeks  =  1;                # from the B Date value
$cal-weeks += 26 div 7;          # OUTPUT: 4 # additional full weeks
$cal-weeks += 1 if 26 mod 7 > 0; # OUTPUT: 5 # plus a partial week
                                             # yields the end result
=end code
